## Introduction

The Decentralized Health Data Exchange is a blockchain-based platform that enables secure and transparent sharing of healthcare data between patients, healthcare providers, and researchers. This project aims to give patients control over their health data while facilitating collaborative research and improving healthcare outcomes.

## Features

- Secure storage of patient data hashes on the blockchain
- Granular access control for healthcare providers
- Data sharing options for research purposes
- Token-based incentives for data contributions
- Privacy-preserving data management

## Smart Contract Overview

The core functionality of the Decentralized Health Data Exchange is implemented in a smart contract written in Clarity. Here's an overview of the main components:

### Constants
- `contract-owner`: The address of the contract deployer
- Error codes for various scenarios

### Data Structures
- `patient-data`: Stores patient data hashes and sharing status
- `access-permissions`: Manages access control for healthcare providers
- `research-contributions`: Tracks patient contributions to research

### Fungible Token
- `data-token`: A fungible token to incentivize data sharing and platform participation

### Key Functions
- `store-data`: Allows patients to store their data hash
- `grant-access` and `revoke-access`: Manage provider access to patient data
- `check-access`: Verify if a provider has access to a patient's data
- `share-with-researchers`: Enable data sharing for research purposes
- `get-patient-data`: Retrieve a patient's data hash

## Installation

To set up the Decentralized Health Data Exchange platform, follow these steps:

1. Install the Clarity SDK and development environment
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Lilian-Mainet/decentralized-health-data-exchange.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd decentralized-health-data-exchange
   ```
4. Deploy the smart contract to your chosen Stacks network (testnet or mainnet)

## Usage

### For Patients

1. Store your health data hash:
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .health-data-exchange store-data <your-data-hash>)
   ```

2. Grant access to a healthcare provider:
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .health-data-exchange grant-access <provider-address>)
   ```

3. Revoke access from a healthcare provider:
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .health-data-exchange revoke-access <provider-address>)
   ```

4. Share your data with researchers:
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .health-data-exchange share-with-researchers)
   ```

### For Healthcare Providers

1. Check if you have access to a patient's data:
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .health-data-exchange check-access <patient-address> <your-address>)
   ```

2. Retrieve a patient's data hash (if authorized):
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .health-data-exchange get-patient-data <patient-address>)
   ```

### For Researchers

1. Access shared patient data for research purposes (implement off-chain)

2. Contribute data tokens to incentivize patient participation (implement off-chain)

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that all interactions with the smart contract are performed through secure, authenticated channels.
- Implement proper key management practices for all participants.
- Regularly audit the smart contract for potential vulnerabilities.
- Consider implementing additional encryption layers for sensitive data.
